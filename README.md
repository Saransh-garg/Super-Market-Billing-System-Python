# Super Market Billing System - Python
## Project Details

The Supermarket Billing System is a Python-based project that simulates a real-world billing system for a retail store. The system is designed to streamline the checkout process by calculating the total bill, applying applicable discounts, and generating an itemized receipt for customers. It leverages conditional statements and loops to handle multiple items and dynamic inputs in real-time.

## Key Functionalities

**Multiple Items in a Single Transaction**
- The system allows for continuous input of items, including their name, quantity, and price.
- Users can add multiple items to a single bill until the checkout process is complete.

**Discount Application Using Conditional Statements**
- Discounts are applied based on predefined criteria such as:
  - **Total Bill Amount** (e.g., 10% off on bills over â‚¹5000)
  - **Item Type** (e.g., 7% off on groceries)

**Bill Calculation**
- The system calculates the **discount amoun**t, and **final total amount due** after discounts.

**Itemized Receipt Generation**
- The receipt displays:
  - **Item Name**
  - **Quantity**
  - **Price per Unit**
  - **Total Price for Each Item**
  - **Discounts, and Final Total**

**Real-Time Interaction Using Loops**
- The system uses **while loops** to allow continuous input until the cashier decides to end the billing process.
## Key Concepts Used

- **Loops:** To handle continuous input until the billing process is complete.
- **Conditional Statements:** To apply discounts based on specified criteria.
- **Interactive Input:** To ensure real-time item entry by the cashier.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** To calculate discounts, and final amounts.
## Conclusion
The Supermarket Billing System efficiently automates the checkout process by handling multiple items, applying discounts, and generating an itemized receipt. It utilizes loops for real-time input and conditional statements for dynamic discount application. The system ensures accurate bill calculation and enhances the customer experience. Overall, it simplifies retail transactions, making the billing process faster and more efficient.
